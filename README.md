# ETL-process-SQL-BigQuery

This project demonstrates Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes using BigQuery as the core platform. 
Guided by the lex parsimoneae (law of parsimony) principle, the project emphasizes simplicity and efficiency in its code. 
Data is extracted from various sources, transformed using BigQuery's powerful capabilities, and loaded into BigQuery for analysis. 
This approach leverages BigQuery's scalability and performance for efficient data management, while maintaining clear and concise code for maintainability.
